Data-Plotting-Gnuplot
=====================

Various examples of how to plot data in Gnuplot


To install gnuplot if it is not already installed, on Raspbian in the terminal use the command:

`sudo apt-get install gnuplot`

To run the examples, in the terminal type and run the command:

`gnuplot example.gnuplot`

If the example creates a plot and opens a window rather than saving to file then in order to get the window to stay open use:

`gnuplot -persist example.gnuplot`

__NOTE__: The time based plots require a specific time range to be given in the gnuplot scripts, otherwise it will be an empty plot
